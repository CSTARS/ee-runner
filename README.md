# ee-runner
Node.js runner for Google Earth Engine scripts. The idea is that the playground scripts can run locally without changes.

Initalize:

* npm install
* python authenticate.py - saves refresh token in config/refresh_token.json

Usage:
* copy your EE Playground code into playground.js
* node ee-runner.js
